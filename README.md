# Gitbook Page to PDF & PNG Converter

Hi, I'm **Mouad Zizi**, a Flutter & Full Stack Developer. You can find more about me at [mouadzizi.com](https://mouadzizi.com).  
I created this script because there is no straightforward way to download a Gitbook as a PDF unless you have a premium plan.

With this Node.js script, you can simply provide the URL of your Gitbook sitemap, and it will do all the work for you!  
The script will generate **PDFs** and **PNG images** for each page, organizing them in a structured directory format like this:

```
menu_data/
    intro/
    page1.png
    page1.pdf
    page2.png
    page2.pdf
another_menu/
    page3.png
    page3.pdf
    page4.png
    page4.pdf
```

# Gitbook to Markdown Converter

This tool scrapes GitBook documentation websites and converts the content to Markdown files with locally saved images.

## Features

- Extracts content from GitBook pages and converts to Markdown format
- Downloads and locally saves all images referenced in the content
- Updates image references in Markdown to point to local images
- Organizes content by categories based on URL structure
- Preserves code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Uses meaningful filenames based on the URL structure
- Accepts GitBook URL as a command-line parameter

## Configuration

You can specify the GitBook URL in two ways:

1. Via command-line argument:
   ```bash
   node src/index_md.js --url https://your-gitbook.com
   # or using the short form
   node src/index_md.js -u https://your-gitbook.com
   ```

2. By editing the default URL in the script:
   ```javascript
   const URL_GITBOOK = "https://docs.othentic.xyz/main";
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with npm:

```bash
# Using the npm script
npm run convert -- --url https://your-gitbook.com

# Or directly
node src/index_md.js --url https://your-gitbook.com
